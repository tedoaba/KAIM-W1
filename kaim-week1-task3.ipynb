As a Data Analyst at Nova Financial Solutions,  your primary task is to conduct a rigorous analysis of the financial news dataset. The focus of your analysis should be two-fold:\n\n*     **Sentiment Analysis:** Perform sentiment analysis on the ‘headline’ text to quantify the tone and sentiment expressed in financial news. This will involve using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to derive sentiment scores, which can be associated with the respective 'Stock Symbol' to understand the emotional context surrounding stock-related news.\n*     **Correlation Analysis:** Establish statistical correlations between the sentiment derived from news articles and the corresponding stock price movements. This involves tracking stock price changes around the date the article was published and analyzing the impact of news sentiment on stock performance. This analysis should consider the publication date and potentially the time the article was published if such data can be inferred or is available.\n\nYour recommendations should leverage insights from this sentiment analysis to suggest investment strategies. These strategies should utilize the relationship between news sentiment and stock price fluctuations to predict future movements. The final report should provide clear, actionable insights based on your analysis, offering innovative strategies to use news sentiment as a predictive tool for stock market trends.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset Overview\n\n### Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset\n\n**FNSPID (Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset)**, is a comprehensive financial dataset designed to enhance stock market predictions by combining quantitative and qualitative data.\n\n- The structure of the [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tLHusoOQOm1cU_7DtLNbykgFgJ_piIpd/view?usp=drive_link) is as follows\n    - `headline`: Article release headline, the title of the news article, which often includes key financial actions like stocks hitting highs, price target changes, or company earnings.\n    - `url`: The direct link to the full news article.\n    - `publisher`: Author/creator of article.\n    - `date`: The publication date and time, including timezone information(UTC-4 timezone).\n    - `stock`: Stock ticker symbol (unique series of letters assigned to a publicly traded company).

The following detailed steps will guide you through this process, including data preparation, sentiment analysis, and correlation analysis.\n\n### Steps to Complete Task 3\n\n#### 1. **Setup GitHub Repository**\n\n1. **Create a New Branch:**\n   ```bash\n   git checkout main\n   git pull origin main\n   git checkout -b task-3\n   ```\n\n2. **Commit Your Work:**\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Set up repository for Task 3 and created branch.\"\n   git push origin task-3\n   ```\n\n#### 2. **Data Preparation**\n\n**Load and Normalize Data:**\n\n1. **Load Datasets:**\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load news data\nnews_file_path = 'path_to_your_news_data.csv'  # Replace with your dataset path\nnews_df = pd.read_csv(news_file_path)\n\n# Load stock price data\nstock_file_path = 'path_to_your_stock_data.csv'  # Replace with your dataset path\nstock_df = pd.read_csv(stock_file_path)\n\n# Convert 'date' columns to datetime\nnews_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(news_df['date'])\nstock_df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(stock_df['Date'])\nstock_df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)\n```\n\n2. **Normalize Dates:**\n\nEnsure that both datasets are aligned by date. If the news dataset has multiple entries per day, aggregate the news sentiment on a daily basis.\n\n```python\n# Aggregate news sentiment by day\nnews_df['date'] = news_df['date'].dt.date\nnews_daily_sentiment = news_df.groupby('date').agg({'headline': 'count', 'sentiment': 'mean'}).reset_index()\nnews_daily_sentiment.rename(columns={'date': 'Date', 'sentiment': 'Avg_Sentiment'}, inplace=True)\nnews_daily_sentiment.set_index('Date', inplace=True)\n```\n\n**Sentiment Analysis:**\n\n3. **Perform Sentiment Analysis:**\n\n```python\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\n\n# Add a sentiment column to news dataframe\nnews_df['sentiment'] = news_df['headline'].apply(lambda x: TextBlob(x).sentiment.polarity)\n```\n\n#### 3. **Calculate Stock Movements**\n\n1. **Compute Daily Returns:**\n\n```python\n# Calculate daily percentage change in stock price\nstock_df['Daily_Return'] = stock_df['Close'].pct_change() * 100\n```\n\n#### 4. **Correlation Analysis**\n\n1. **Aggregate Sentiments:**\n\nEnsure the average daily sentiment scores are available and aligned with stock daily returns.\n\n```python\n# Merge daily news sentiment with stock data\nmerged_df = pd.merge(stock_df[['Daily_Return']], news_daily_sentiment, left_index=True, right_index=True)\n```\n\n2. **Calculate Correlation:**\n\n```python\n# Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient\ncorrelation = merged_df[['Avg_Sentiment', 'Daily_Return']].corr().iloc[0, 1]\nprint(f'Pearson correlation coefficient between average daily sentiment and stock daily returns: {correlation:.2f}')\n```\n\n#### 5. **Visualizations**\n\nVisualize the relationship between sentiment scores and stock returns.\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Plot daily returns and average sentiment\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))\n\n# Plot stock returns\nplt.subplot(2, 1, 1)\nplt.plot(merged_df.index, merged_df['Daily_Return'], label='Daily Return', color='blue')\nplt.title('Daily Stock Returns')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Return (%)')\nplt.legend()\n\n# Plot average sentiment\nplt.subplot(2, 1, 2)\nplt.plot(merged_df.index, merged_df['Avg_Sentiment'], label='Average Sentiment', color='orange')\nplt.title('Average Daily Sentiment')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Sentiment Score')\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n# Scatter plot to visualize correlation\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.scatterplot(data=merged_df, x='Avg_Sentiment', y='Daily_Return', alpha=0.5)\nplt.title('Sentiment Score vs. Stock Returns')\nplt.xlabel('Average Sentiment Score')\nplt.ylabel('Daily Return (%)')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Example Commit Messages\n\n1. “Set up the repository and created branch for Task 3.”\n2. “Loaded and normalized news and stock price data.”\n3. “Performed sentiment analysis on news headlines.”\n4. “Calculated daily stock returns and aggregated sentiment scores.”\n5. “Conducted correlation analysis and visualized results.”\n\n### Final Notes\n\n- **Data Alignment:** Ensure that dates in both datasets are aligned correctly, and handle missing values or discrepancies if necessary.\n- **Sentiment Analysis:** Choose a sentiment analysis method that fits your needs; TextBlob is used here, but other methods or libraries could be used for more advanced analysis.\n- **Correlation Analysis:** The Pearson correlation coefficient provides a measure of the linear relationship between sentiment scores and stock returns. Consider additional statistical tests or models if needed.\n\nFeel free to adjust the code and analysis based on the specific features of your datasets and analysis requirements.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To ensure Task 3 is completed comprehensively and in detail, let’s break down each step carefully.
