As a Data Analyst at Nova Financial Solutions,  your primary task is to conduct a rigorous analysis of the financial news dataset. The focus of your analysis should be two-fold:\n\n*     **Sentiment Analysis:** Perform sentiment analysis on the ‘headline’ text to quantify the tone and sentiment expressed in financial news. This will involve using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to derive sentiment scores, which can be associated with the respective 'Stock Symbol' to understand the emotional context surrounding stock-related news.\n*     **Correlation Analysis:** Establish statistical correlations between the sentiment derived from news articles and the corresponding stock price movements. This involves tracking stock price changes around the date the article was published and analyzing the impact of news sentiment on stock performance. This analysis should consider the publication date and potentially the time the article was published if such data can be inferred or is available.\n\nYour recommendations should leverage insights from this sentiment analysis to suggest investment strategies. These strategies should utilize the relationship between news sentiment and stock price fluctuations to predict future movements. The final report should provide clear, actionable insights based on your analysis, offering innovative strategies to use news sentiment as a predictive tool for stock market trends.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset Overview\n\n### Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset\n\n**FNSPID (Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset)**, is a comprehensive financial dataset designed to enhance stock market predictions by combining quantitative and qualitative data.\n\n- The structure of the [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tLHusoOQOm1cU_7DtLNbykgFgJ_piIpd/view?usp=drive_link) is as follows\n    - `headline`: Article release headline, the title of the news article, which often includes key financial actions like stocks hitting highs, price target changes, or company earnings.\n    - `url`: The direct link to the full news article.\n    - `publisher`: Author/creator of article.\n    - `date`: The publication date and time, including timezone information(UTC-4 timezone).\n    - `stock`: Stock ticker symbol (unique series of letters assigned to a publicly traded company).

Useful for identifying medium-term trends.\n- **200-Day SMA:** Long-term trend indicator. Helps in understanding long-term trends.\n\n**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**\n- **Overbought (>70):** Stock might be due for a correction.\n- **Oversold (<30):** Stock might be undervalued or due for a rebound.\n\n**MACD:**\n- **MACD Line vs. Signal Line:** The crossing points can indicate buy or sell signals.\n- **MACD Histogram:** Shows the difference between MACD and the Signal Line, indicating momentum.\n\n**Visualizations:**\n- **Moving Averages Plot:** Helps in visualizing how the stock price relates to short-term and long-term trends.\n- **RSI Plot:** Shows overbought or oversold conditions and helps in timing buy or sell decisions.\n- **MACD Plot:** Provides insights into momentum and potential buy/sell signals.\n\n### Example Commit Messages\n\n1. “Set up the repository and created branch for Task 2.”\n2. “Loaded and prepared stock price data.”\n3. “Calculated technical indicators using TA-Lib: SMA, RSI, and MACD.”\n4. “Visualized stock price data with technical indicators.”\n\n### Final Notes\n\n- Ensure that the data you use for financial metrics and technical analysis is accurate and up-to-date.\n- Review and validate your visualizations and indicators for correctness.\n- Adapt the code based on the specific features of your dataset and the methods available in `PyNance`.\n\nFeel free to adjust the code and analysis according to your specific needs and dataset characteristics.","metadata":{}}]}
